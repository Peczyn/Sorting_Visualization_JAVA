## Java Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a Java-based sorting algorithm visualizer, allowing you to interactively explore and understand various sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science, used to arrange elements of a list or array in a specific order.

### Features:
- Visualization of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort and more.
- Customizable array size ("todo" and speed controls) to observe algorithm behaviors.
- User-friendly interface built with Java Swing for easy interaction.

### How to Use:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peczyn/Sorting_Visualization_JAVA
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   cd Sorting_Visualization_JAVA
   ./run.sh
   ```

3. **Interact:**
   - Choose a sorting algorithm the menu.
   - Adjust the array size (and sorting speed).
   - Click "Sort" to visualize the algorithm in action.

### Supported Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- ... and more!
